Each owner has a name, address, unique ID, Mobile number, date of birth and number of vehicles owned. In this mobile number is a multivalued attribute.Owner applies for a license. Each license consists of a license no, License Validity, and license type.Vehicles is registered by respective owners. Each vehicle has a Chassis number, fuel type, vehicle type, registration date, vehicle number and its color.If the owner breaks any traffic rule, then the vehicle gets a challan. Each challan has fine amount, challan number, challan date and time at which challan was given, and challan details.if any accident or rule break occurs in any locality the respective RTO jurisdiction will get the message as soon as the challan is generated. It will also store the no. of accidents or challan in a day, which will help to reduce the accident rate and punish the people who break the rule.To control and bring a revolution in traffic management, our database is a little different than regular RTO system, every vehicle has a fixed credit point that is 25 in out database and as the owner breaks rules, the credit points of the respective vehicle decreases and as the limit gets below 7, the license of the vehicle s owner is cancelled (he also has to pay the challan)The challan is generated by a traffic inspector. Each inspector has an ID, name and designation.
